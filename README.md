# Pokemon poke who?

A learning project to test [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) features with the aim of getting a very quick and snappy user experience (faster than React). Uses [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended), both [getStaticProps()](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) and [getStaticPaths()](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-paths), optimized [.webp](https://caniuse.com/webp) images, inline fonts and other tricks for optimization.
