# Pokemon poke who?

A small side-project to test [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) features with the aim of getting a very quick and snappy user experience (faster than React). Uses [Static Generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages#static-generation-recommended), both [getStaticProps()](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-props) and [getStaticPaths()](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/data-fetching/get-static-paths), optimized [.webp](https://caniuse.com/webp) images, inline fonts and other tricks for optimization.

To be able to host the production build in a subfolder, a basepath of "/portfolio/pokemon-poke-who" is used so when testing with 'yarn dev' or 'yarn start', use the following url: http://localhost:3000/portfolio/pokemon-poke-who

## Features

Contains a listing of Pokemons that can be sorted by clicking on the column header. When clicking the name of a Pokemon, a detailed view of the Pokemon is shown.
